# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
  First take navbar from reactbootstrap.
  then do UI for separate taps
  Data is static and insert in card using reactbootstrap
  Merge with navbar all the cards
  using routes and link to naviagte app.js
  routes are used to navigate internal components
